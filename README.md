# N-Queen-Problem
This project is about N-Queen Problem using Hill-Climbing Algorithm (Java). It was about an assigment for my Artificial Intelligence cource in Uni (AUEB).
It is not perfect and definitely needs some changes, but i think is a solid first try.

To run it, simply download the code and compile it via your IDE or terminal. It uses standard Java libraries so you do not need to download something else.
